## Server & Browser?

1. Server waits for request from browser on the internet. E.g web pages, images, sounds, videos. Server will retrieve them for you.

2. Server will locate the resources and send back to the browser, because the server stores all the html files and other file types.


1. Browser allow user to surf it and visit sites in its browser window to display the page after getting the html files which have the page's content and structure.
