<!-- <span> separates inline elements, <div> separates block-level content. -->




<!-- <div> cannot be use, because it would create linebreaks, also it is used for creating new content blocks, in this case, we want them to be on the same line. -->


<!-- <em> is for emphasizing -->


<!-- <strong> is for big points -->


<!-- <span> provides styling for words which you can group them by creating classes -->
