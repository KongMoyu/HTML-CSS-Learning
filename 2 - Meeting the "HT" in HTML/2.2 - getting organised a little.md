## Basically, an upside down tree. Root at the top, which path down into branches.

1. Lounge folder: the top-level folder (root folder), containing the main HTML lounge file.

2. About folder: a sub folder under lounge folder, containing HTML directiond, management, events files and so on.

3. Beverages folder: a sub folder under lounge folder, containing HTML beverages information files and so on.

4. Image folder: a sub folder under lounge folder, containing all the gif, jpg, png image files and so on. Easier for reusing of images.

!!! Relative path to the href destination will change: "Go to folder / File name". E.g <a href="beverages/elixir.html">elixirs</a>  

!! If you want to go back to the parent folder for the main lounge.html file, use ../lounge.html, the browser will look UP one folder from current opening folder.

! If you want to go up two parent folder: ../../destination filename. Also, it is *not* called the "grandparent folder", it is the "the parent of the parent folder".
