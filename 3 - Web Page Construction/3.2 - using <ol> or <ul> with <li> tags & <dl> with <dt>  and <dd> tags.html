<!-- Description -->

		<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:</p>

		<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>

		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>

<!-- <blockquote> element creates its own separate block (like <p>, a new paragraph) and indent the quote, without the "" signs. Basically it allows the quote to break out of the description paragraph (with a linebreak before and after it), use it one paragraph by paragraph. Also, you can use <q> inside it! -->

<!-- Burma Shave slogan style, <br> (a void element = no value to process: <img> & <br> ) for line breaks, it doesn't have any content, so no need </br>. -->

		<blockquote>
 			Passing cars, <br>
			When you can't see, <br>
			May get you, <br>
			A glimpse, <br>
			Of eternity. <br>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

<!-- <q> element is for inline quotes, it just adds the "" for you in the browser and has the added easy for CSS styling, because <em> is very limited in some case. -->

		<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p> 

<!-- <ul>: tag, it is for Unordered List, a block element, because it creates a linebreak -->

<!-- !!! You can have a <ol> <li> or <ul> <li> list (nested list) within a normal <li> list item. -->

		<ul>

			<li>cell phone</li>
			<li>iPad</li>
			<li>digital camera</li>
			<li>and a protein bar</li>
    
		</ul>

		<p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q></p>

		<p>Packing List:</p>

<!-- !!! You can have a <ol> <li> or <ul> <li> list (nested list) within a normal <li> list item. -->

		<ol>
			<li>Charge Segway</li>
			<li>Pack for trip
				<ul>
					<li>cell phone</li>
					<li>iPad</li>
					<li>digital camera</li>
					<li>and a protein bar</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Call mom</li>
