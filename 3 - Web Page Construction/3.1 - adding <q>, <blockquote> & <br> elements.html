		<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway</p>

<!-- Heading -->

<!-- Description -->

		<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.</p>
	
		<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>

		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>

<!-- <blockquote> element creates its own separate block (like <p>, a new paragraph) and indent the quote, without the "" signs. Basically it allows the quote to break out of the description paragraph (with a linebreak before and after it), use it one paragraph by paragraph. Also, you can use <q> inside it! -->

<!-- Burma Shave slogan style, <br> (a void element = no value to process: <img> & <br> ) for line breaks, it doesn't have any content, so no need </br>. -->

		<blockquote>
 			Passing cars, <br>
			When you can't see, <br>
			May get you, <br>
			A glimpse, <br>
			Of eternity. <br>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

<!-- <q> element is for inline quotes, it just adds the "" for you in the browser and has the added easy for CSS styling, because <em> is very limited in some case. -->

		<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPad, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q></p>
